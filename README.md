COMiniSatPS simplified
======================

This is a modification of the COMiniSatPS solver that participated in the SAT2015
competition. I have kept only the `core` solver, the `simp` solver is removed.
I am trying to simplify it as much as possible, removing unused parts, and converting
it to the c++11 standard. Ultimately I am trying to understand its inner workings.
